# clockProject

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving?
- In this project, the assignment was to create a clock that can be modified by the user with a menu selection in the console. When the project is ran, it will display current system time in a 12 hour and 24 hour format along with a menu that allows the user to add an hour, a minute or second to both clocks. The last option will stop the program. 

Where did you do particularly well?
- I feel like my execution on the entire project was very successful. I am mainly happy that I was able to print current system time when the project is ran. This was my biggest challenge throughout the entire assignment

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient,secure and so on?
- Looking at the grade I recieved for the project, I believe I have executed the asked very well. None of the code is in the main and each aspect of the project has its own functions. I think adding more details on the comments where I wrote code to derive time from the system would be helpful and explain my thought process more clearly.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
- A lot of the challenging parts of the code was priting the time correctly formatted on the screen. It was more tedeious than challenging. I just ran the code and noted each mistake. I would address each mistake and run again to see the changes displayed in the console. I did use cplusplus.com for some research and resources on formatting functions and classes when I was confused and it was a very helpful resources that I will continue to use

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
- This project set the basis for clean and good quality C++ code in my career moving forward. Writing classes and functions along with not having secure code will definitely be the standard for me writing projects and programs in the future. 

How did you make this program maintanable, readable, and adaptable?
- The code written for this project is commmented heavily to inform any other contributer of the logic and thought process that went into creating the code. All inputs and outputs have meaning. I also paid attention and made sure to make the code as consise as possible without taking away from the integrity of the assignment. Other users and developers would be able to follow my work and improve it or build on it for an application or program that requires this as a basis of the code.
