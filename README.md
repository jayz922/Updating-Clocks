# clockProject

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving?
- In this project, the assignment was to create a clock that can be modified by the user with a menu selection in the console. When the project is ran, it will display current system time in a 12 hour and 24 hour format along with a menu that allows the user to add an hour, a minute or second to both clocks. The last option will stop the program.
